# Sign-Language-Recognition-System

## Overview
This project focuses on recognizing sign language gestures using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system captures hand gestures through images and classifies them into corresponding sign language symbols, enabling better communication support for the hearing and speech impaired community.

## Objectives
- To detect and recognize hand gestures accurately  
- To convert sign language gestures into readable text  
- To improve accessibility and inclusive communication using technology  

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition  
- High accuracy using trained machine learning models  
- User-friendly and scalable system  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning  
- TensorFlow / Keras (if used)  
- NumPy, Pandas  

## Methodology
1. Data collection and preprocessing  
2. Hand detection and feature extraction  
3. Model training and validation  
4. Gesture classification  
5. Result visualization and prediction
